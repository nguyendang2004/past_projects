# Data Model

Designing the data model for your Waste Reduction Tracker app:

<!-- ### Entities:

1. **User:**
   - `UserID` (Unique identifier)
   - `Username`
   - `Email`
   - `Password` (Hashed and salted)
   - `QRCode` (Generated unique QR code for each user)
   - `GooglePayLink` (Link to the user's Google Pay account)

2. **Reusable Item:**
   - `ItemID` (Unique identifier)
   - `ItemType` (e.g., Coffee Cup, Straw, Smoothie Cup, Takeaway Box)
   - `ShopID` (Reference to the shop that accepts this reusable item)

3. **Shop:**
   - `ShopID` (Unique identifier)
   - `ShopName`
   - `Location` (Latitude and Longitude)
   - `Category` (e.g., Cafe, Restaurant)
   - `PointsConfig` (Customized points for each reusable item type)
   - `AccumulationThreshold` (Total points required for a discount)
   - `DiscountAmount` (Amount of discount for a certain threshold)
   - `NGOList` (List of NGOs partnering with the shop)

4. **Transaction:**
   - `TransactionID` (Unique identifier)
   - `UserID` (Reference to the user making the purchase)
   - `ShopID` (Reference to the shop where the purchase is made)
   - `ReusableItemID` (Reference to the reusable item being used)
   - `PointsEarned` (Points earned for the transaction)
   - `DonationOption` (Boolean indicating whether the user opted for donation)
   - `DonationAmount` (Amount donated if donation option is selected)

5. **NGO:**
   - `NGOID` (Unique identifier)
   - `NGOName`
   - `Cause` (e.g., Reforestation, Hunger)

### Entities:

1. **User:**
   - `UserID` (Unique identifier)
   - `Username`
   - `Email`
   - `Password` (Hashed and salted)
   <!-- - `BarCode` (Generated unique QR code for each user) -->
   - `GooglePayLink` (Link to the user's Google Pay account)

2. **Reusable Item:**
   - `ItemID` (Unique identifier)
   - `ItemType` (e.g., Coffee Cup, Straw, Smoothie Cup, Takeaway Box)
   - `Assets` (Image etc)

3. **Shop:**
   - `ShopID` (Unique identifier)
   - `ShopName` 
   - `Location` (Latitude and Longitude, Address, etc)
   - `Category` (e.g., Cafe, Restaurant)
   - `AccumulationThreshold` (Total points required for a discount)
   - `DiscountAmount` (Amount of discount for a certain threshold)
   - `NGOList` (List of NGOs (IDs) partnering with the shop)

4. **Transaction:**
   - `TransactionID` (Unique identifier)
   - `UserID` (Reference to the user making the purchase)
   - `ShopID` (Reference to the shop where the purchase is made)
   - `ScannableBarcode` (Generated by concatenating UserID and ItemID for scanning)
   - `PointsEarned` (Points earned for the transaction)
   - `DonationOption` (Boolean indicating whether the user opted for donation) if applicable
   - `DonationAmount` (Amount donated if donation option is selected) if applicable

5. **NGO:**
   - `NGOID` (Unique identifier)
   - `NGOName`
   - `Cause` (e.g., Reforestation, Hunger)
   - `Advertisement` (Information about the NGO's cause and promotion)
   

### Relationships:

- **User-Transaction:** One-to-Many relationship. A user can have multiple transactions, and each transaction is associated with one user.

- **Shop-Transaction:** One-to-Many relationship. A shop can have multiple transactions, and each transaction is associated with one shop.

- **Shop-NGO:** Many-to-Many relationship. A shop can partner with multiple NGOs, and an NGO can partner with multiple shops.

- **Shop-ReusableItem:** Many-to-Many relationship. A shop can accept multiple types of reusable items, and each reusable item is associated with any shop.

- **User-ReusableItem:** Many-to-Many relationship. A user can have multiple reusable items, and each reusable item is associated with any user.

### Additional Points Configuration for Each Shop:

6. **ShopPointsConfiguration:**
   - `ShopID` (Reference to the shop)
   - `ItemID` (Reference to the reusable item)
   - `PointsConfig` (Customized points for each reusable item type)

### Display Information for the Shop:

After a user scans an item at the shop, the shop can retrieve the user's identity and the scanned item(s) using the `ScannableBarcode` in the transaction record.

This model ensures that each user has a unique identity, and the scannable barcode is generated based on the concatenation of the user ID and item ID. Shops can have their own points configuration for different reusable items, and the transaction records will capture the relevant information for reporting and display at the shop's end.
